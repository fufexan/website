Currently, a B.Sc. student at TUCN, specializing in Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology.

Some of my general areas of interest include:
- programming (preferably functional) and computers in general (from silicon to cloud)
- music (will detail below)
- books (nothing like a bit of reading before bed)
- cool physics stuff (especially electronic)

In terms of music, I find my tastes constantly evolving. Currently, the main genres I listen to are drum and bass, house, Romanian R&B, but at times I also listen to rock (from the '80s onwards), ambient, post-rock/blackgaze/depressive black metal, etc. See more on my [last.fm](https://last.fm/user/fufexan).

I currently use and contribute to [NixOS](https://nixos.org). I sometimes hang out in the NixOS unofficial Discord, chatting and helping. See my configuration [here](https://dots.fufexan.net);

My desktop revolves around [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org), where I am the maintainer of the build systems/CI side of things.

For more software, see [my GitHub](https://github.com/fufexan).
