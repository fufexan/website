Hi! I'm Mihai, a B.Sc. student at TUCN, specializing in Electronics and Telecommunications.

My interests include Nix/NixOS, Rust, and Linux in general. I usually hang out in the NixOS unofficial Discord, chatting and helping whenever I can.

I maintain several packages and modules in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs); the Nix & Meson side of [HyprWM](https://github.com/hyprwm), and contribute to projects I find interesting.

Currently unemployed, so if you want me to work for you, please reach out. CV available [here](https://github.com/fufexan/cv).
